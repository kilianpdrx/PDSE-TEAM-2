This repository contains the code for the project realized by Kilian Pouderoux, Benjamin Deprez, Lucas Shang, GaÃ«lle Pillon and Tirui Wang as part of the course Products Design and Systems Engineering given at EPFL during the fall 2024/2025 semester.

This project introduces an autonomous robotic platform designed to assist users in carrying heavy
loads safely and efficiently in public indoor spaces. The code present in this repository concerns the prototype realized for the in-class demonstration.

### Computer vision
This folder contains the code related to the following feature. The main scripts are serveur.py and clean_client.py, which are used as the web client/server interface.

### MotorFSM
This folder contains the Finite State Machine allowing motor control via raspberry pi reading and sensor outputs.

### Joystick_working
This contains the code to control the robot through the app

### Others
-  PDSE.apk : the mobile app ready to be installed (only for android)
-  calibration.m : used to make the linear approximations for the estimation of the user's distance from the camera.
